// Fields every log line carries without each call passing them (SOL-46):
// - environment: the Worker's ENVIRONMENT, so Workers Observability can
//   filter by it.
// - traceId: one run of work, followed across sol-gate, sol-integrate,
//   sol-notify and sol-api. Every log line has one.
// - submissionId: the form submission the work is for, assigned by Sol Gate.
//   Only on lines that are for a submission. A replayed submission would keep
//   its submissionId under a new traceId.
// Both ids travel between services as TRACE_ID_HEADER / SUBMISSION_ID_HEADER.
//
// A request uses its caller's traceId, or starts a new one; it uses the
// caller's submissionId, but never makes one up. Set per request (index.ts);
// AsyncLocalStorage carries them through every await and waitUntil below
// that (the send runs in waitUntil), and lib/sol-api.ts forwards them — only
// to sol-api, never to Resend or Mailtrap.
